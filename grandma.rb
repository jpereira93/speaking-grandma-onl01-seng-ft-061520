def speak_to_grandma(phrase)
  phrase = 
  #if phrase is not uppercase then print out huh?! speak up sonny
  #if the phrase is in uppercase then she'll say no, not since 1938!
  #If phrase is exactly equal to I LOVE YOU grandma! IT WILL PRINT OUT I love you too pumpkin
end
# Whatever you say to grandma, she should respond with
# HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!
# unless you shout it (type in all capitals).

# If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) 
# and yells back

# NO, NOT SINCE 1938!

# However if you say 'I LOVE YOU GRANDMA!', she should respond with
# 'I LOVE YOU TOO PUMPKIN!'
